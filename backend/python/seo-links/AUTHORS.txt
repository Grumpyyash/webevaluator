Pylinkvalidator was originally created as part of pylinkchecker in 2013 by
Barthelemy Dagenais while he was working at Xprima Inc. It has been forked on
June 24th 2014 with the name pylinkvalidator.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, and generally made
pylinkvalidator that much better:

Arun Elias
Jim Priest <jpriest@redhat.com>
